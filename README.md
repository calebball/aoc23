# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 🎁

Welcome to my solutions to the 2023 edition of Advent of Code!

This year I'm working in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), which is a fun language that primarily targets the Erlang VM.

If you'd like to run these solutions then you'll need to [install Gleam](https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/).
With that done you can pass the day, the part and the input file to process.
For example
```shell
gleam run day1 part1 input/day1.txt
```
